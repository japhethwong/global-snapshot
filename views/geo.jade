    h2 What is this page?
    p
      | The images above are being sent to you in real-time from Instagram
      | users who geo-tag their posts. As the user presses the "done" button,
      | Instagram's servers notify this independent server of a new photo
      | through a simple web hook.
    p
      | Using Instagram's new real-time updates API, any developer can subscribe
      | to new photos from a variety of sources.
      | In this demo, we've subscribed to a handful of city-centers with a radius
      | of 5km. This means that Instagram will notify this server every time an
      | Instagram user tags their photo with a location within 5km of the city
      | center.
    p
      | If you happen to live in: Austin, Boston, Chicago, Columbus, Detroit, Hong Kong, Houston, Kyoto, Las Vegas, London, Los Angeles, Palo Alto, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, San Antonio, San Diego, San Jose, Sao Paulo, Seattle, Seoul or Singapore
      | you should try posting for yourself. Simply take a photo with Instagram,
      | tag it with a location, and then post it. Watch the page to see your photo
      | show up instantaneously.

    h2 What are real-time updates?
    p
      | Real-time updates allow Instagram to notify developers when users post new
      | photos. Of course, having a firehose of data would be a bit overwhelming
      | for most, so we've made it extremely easy for developers to subscribe to
      | new photos posted that meet certain criteria.
    p
      | Developers can subscribe to new photos taken by users, on tags, from a place, or a specific geography.
      | By subscribing, developers can receive notifications the instant new photos are posted
      | instead of relying upon antiquated polling methods.
    h2 How do you create subscriptions?
    p
      | First, you need to register for a developer account at the
      a(href="http://instagram.com/developer/") Instagram Developer Center
      | then review the
      a(href="http://instagram.com/developer/realtime/") real-time developer documentation.
      | You'll see that subscribing is as easy as issuing a single curl command.
